## Description
This project attempts to create a web interface for the research project "Computational study of the rovibrational levels of diatomic molecules".
It calculates the vibrational constant for first and second term, rotational constant in equilibrium constant, rotational constant in first term and 
centrifugal distortion constant all in cm-1. The website is : https://pchem13.herokuapp.com/

## To run the website:
You will need Flask python 3 and gunicorn installed. Later to run, type: python3 app.py

## Additional details for Input:
The website calculates the constants for diatomic molecules and requires a file in a .txt format with the internuclear distance on the left in angstroms and eneergies on thr right in atomuc units and also number of basis sets

## Support:
You can contact me for any failures or problems with the site
